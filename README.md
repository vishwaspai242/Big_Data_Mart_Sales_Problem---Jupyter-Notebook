# Big_Data_Mart_Sales_Problem--Jupyter-Notebook

Problem Statement:

building a predictive model and finding out the sales of each product at a particular store

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing the sales of their products.

The dataset includes two files:

bigdatamart_Train.csv: Use this file for the model building purpose.

bigdatamart_Test.csv: Use this file for getting predictions from the trained model.


The list of all the column names and a short description about it.
